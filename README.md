### What I learned

I learned a lot about react, how to use another libraries and how to use 'useRef' hook.

### Continued development

I need to learn using git, and how to write faster with VS code.
Also I need to deal with more libraries.

### Useful resources

- [Countdown timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countdown) - I used this library for the timer. This library is good but need to make more samples, for how to use it.
- [React Circular Progressbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-circular-progressbar) - I used this library for circular timer and this library is amazing
